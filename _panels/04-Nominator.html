<section><h3>Create Zukma address to receive payments</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a "set-it-and-forget-it" approach to leverage your ZEP coins, then becoming a Zukma nominator is the way to go. As a nominator, you are participating in the staking system of Zukma. Nominators use a specified amount of their funds to "vote" for Zukma validators. Validators are network nodes that participate in the consensus and block authoring process. Your job as a nominator is to appoint (stake) your ZEP to elect the active set of validators. The active validators list consists of validators that received the most ZEP as "votes". If your chosen validator makes it to the active set, he will earn rewards and ideally share them with all of his nominators.</p>
