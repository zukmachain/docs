<p><a href="https://github.com/zukmachain/zukma"><b>Zukma</b></a> is a living network with the core pillars in true decentralization, cross-chain operability and seamless upgradability. Both networks have an advanced suite of governance tools and, using the Substrate framework that allows autonomous deployment of upgrades (forkless updates). The Zukma Chain are adapting therefore to the growing needs of a DeFi loving community without the risk of dividing the community by blockchain forks.

By connecting the three pillars (Decentralization, Cross-Chain Operability and Forkless Upgrades) the Zukma ecosystem serves as a foundational layer for a truly decentralized DeFi network, where DeFi users control their data and are not limited by trust bounds within the network.

<p><b>Zukma</b> Polkadot.js are full nodes, upgradeable to <b>Governance</b> and the most secure way to access the network. Full node client downloads a complete copy of the blockchain and participating in transactions verification. Mobile clients are using SPV protocol to communicate with full nodes and perform operations without downloading a full copy of the blockchain.</p>

<h2>Staking</h2>
<p>In staking, you can be either a nominator or a validator.

As a nominator, you can nominate validator candidates that you trust to help you earn rewards in the chain's native coin.

</p>

<h4>Validator</h4>
<p>The staking system on Zukma is designed to pay out rewards equally to all validators, regardless of their stake. That means the amount of staked coins on a validator does not influence its ability to author or validate more blocks. However, there is a probabilistic component to reward calculation (discussed below), so rewards may not be exactly equal for all validators in a given era.</p>

<h4>Nominator</h4>
<p>The rewards for nominators are paid out pro-rata after the validator reward is deducted. That means your share of the total nominator rewards per validator will increase with the number of coins you staked on that specific validator. This system should motivate nominators to stake on lower-staked validators and thus should create a balanced-staked validator set.</p>
